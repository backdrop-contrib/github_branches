GitHub Branches
===============

Creates a report page/form where you can enter the name of a GitHub fork, then
see a list of all its branches and the associated pull requests from the parent
repo. This may help you to clean up your fork's branches; for example, where
your pull request was merged but the issue-specific branch wasn't deleted.
